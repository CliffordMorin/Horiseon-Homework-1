# Horiseon-Homework-1

-In this project we were given an HTML and a CSS file in which were non-semantic and did not adhere to Web accessibility. Therefore, I had to change the HTML and CSS to adhere to the HTML5 semantics and make the file meet the accessibility standards.

-After the HTML and CSS were completed I had to make a new repository in github and upload all of my file's to it
